- Modules should be organised  by areas of work, each area could have a manager that will have access to all capabilities of that module, and below collaborators will have only specific capabilities and access.
- Modules must run standalone but should be able to communicate with other modules in simple and easy way.
- Modules should be managed in simple way and when enabled should be able to automatically communicates with any other module in system
- Modules must be able to grow in wide and depth ways, it means that we should be able to develop more functionalities for each module and nest some "sub-modules" in it.
