## Our name
We chose to name our ERP 'INES' to reflect its core values and to honor the city we now call home.

- 'INES' is an acronym for 'Integração, Negócios, Eficiência, e Soluções.' This emphasizes the ERP's primary function: seamlessly integrating business processes, driving operational efficiency, and providing comprehensive solutions for our clients.
- Ines is also an honorable historic figure, Queen Inês de Castro, a significant figure in Portuguese history. We believe this name carries a sense of strength, resilience, and lasting legacy, qualities we strive to embody in our ERP solution.
