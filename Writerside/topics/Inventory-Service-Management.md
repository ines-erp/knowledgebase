- Product tracking: Track products by SKU, batch/lot numbers, serial numbers, or expiration dates.
- Supplier management (in conjunction with the purchasing module): Manage supplier information, track lead times, and link purchase orders to inventory updates.
- Product cost calculation: Calculate product costs using methods like FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average for accurate financial reporting.

## Use cases
- Add New Inventory Item: A user adds a new product to the inventory, including details like SKU, category, cost, and stock level.
- Receive Stock from Supplier: A user records incoming stock from a supplier, matching it to a purchase order and updating inventory levels.
- Transfer Stock Between Warehouses: A user transfers items from one warehouse to another, updating stock levels in both locations.
- Adjust Stock Levels: A user manually adjusts stock levels to account for discrepancies like damage or loss.
- Notify Low Stock: The system sends an alert when stock levels for a consumable item fall below the minimum threshold.
- Track Product Expiry: A user tracks items with expiration dates and receives alerts for soon-to-expire stock.
- Generate Inventory Reports: A user generates reports like stock movement, aging analysis, or inventory valuation.
