# Coding (early decisions)

## 16 Monday -Dec-2024.

I am thinking about to develop this software in C# (c sharp), with entity framework and PostgreSQL for database, in front-end I will go with ReactJS. For VCS *(version control system)* I will start with github, but intent to move to GitLab or Gitea in self hosted server in the future.

This should follows the OOP *(object oriented programming)* approach and should try to implement as many as possible of the available good practices already documented.

For start it should rum from docker, and maybe it module that runs detached would be a new services in docker-compose.
